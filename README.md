Welcome to my solutions for the TechSoC-28 problem statements! Below, you'll find detailed descriptions and implementations for each task.

## Task 1: Modern Calculator
### Concepts Used:
- Control Statements
- Conditional Statements

### Problem Statement:
Design a modern calculator in any programming language. The calculator must fulfill the following requirements:
- Perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Include advanced functions such as logarithms and trigonometric calculations **without using math libraries**.
- Solve quadratic equations using the quadratic formula.

### Additional Features:
- Solve systems of linear equations (at least for \(n = 2\)).
- Perform differentiation and integration for simple mathematical functions.

## Task 2: Academic Roll Record System
### Concepts Used:
- File Management
- Functions
- Escape Sequences
- Strings

### Problem Statement:
Develop a program that mimics a student academic roll record system with the following features:

1. **User Registration and Login:**
   - Allow users to register as either students or admins using a unique user ID and password.
   - Implement role-based access control:
     - **Admins:** Manage and input grades.
     - **Students:** View grades and performance indices.

2. **Grade Management:**
   - Admins can input and update grades for students for each semester.
   - Each course is worth 4 credits, and the number of courses per semester is decided by the admin.
   - Grades follow the IITI curriculum grading system (e.g., AP (10), AA (10), AB (9), etc.).

3. **Performance Index Calculation:**
   - Calculate and display the Semester Performance Index (SPI) for each semester.
   - Calculate and display the Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) across all completed semesters.

4. **Academic Details Display:**
   - Show student ID, grades for each course, SPI, and CPI for all semesters.

### Notes:
- Store all registered user details (students and admins) along with their respective grades.
- Ensure secure handling of user credentials and role-based functionality.

## Task 3: Snake Game
### Concepts Used:
- Graphics Programming
- Event Handling
- Logic Implementation

### Problem Statement:
Develop a virtual game using any programming language. The preferred choice is the classic **Snake Game**, which many of us enjoyed during childhood.

### Requirements:
- Implement a functional Snake Game with:
  - Snake movement.
  - Food collection to grow the snake.
  - Collision detection (game over when the snake collides with itself or the boundary).
- Add scoring functionality to track the player's progress.
- Enhance the user experience with smooth animations and controls.
